# Download files

### Metadata

For each project (PRJEB14474 and PRJEB13117) go the sra website (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) and copy the project id in the 
search bar (search within "sra"). When you get the results, select "Send to:" > "Run Selector" > "OK".  In the middle table, click the 
buttons to download the "Metadata".

I may have also made some manual adjustments to the files. I often change the file extension to ".csv" so that it opens correctly in Excel.  I guess I changed the "Run" column to "ID" in one of the files.  Just the head of the files is included in this folder.

### Sequence Data

Go to the "Run selector" (just like above for the metadata). This time use the "Accession List" button.

Use a simple loop to download each file. See "download_start.sh".  If you are lucky, that will work all the way and be all you need.

In my case, the download worked for several files before hitting an error, and I had to restart the process several times, adjusting my script to not re-download files that were already present. And I ultimately decided to split the 3,079-file download into more manageable batches in subfolders.

The sequence data itself is not part of this reposiotry. If re-running this pipeline, make sure that scripts that read sequence data are set to look wherever you have downloaded the data, and accomodate any subdirectory structure you have implemented.

### Taxonomic Reference

The silva reference data is assumed to be in a "tax" folder in the home dir.

"~/tax/silva_nr99_v138.1_train_set.fa.gz
"~/tax/silva_species_assignment_v138.1.fa.gz"
